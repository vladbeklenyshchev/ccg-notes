# Guide to positioning your units in Arena

## TL;DR - the most important points:
- Play only on two rows (Melee and Siege) and do NOT rowstack.
- Put weak units at the end of your rows (Crushing Trap, Milaen).
- When possible, put low units between 4+ strength units (Arachas Venom).

## In depth

**In a gamemode where your opponent can have literally any card in the game, it can be difficult to play around every possibility.**

Do not excessively stack one single row to play around:
- Lacerate
- Rotfiend
- Moonlight (And all cards that can create Nekurat)
- Dol Blathanna Bomber
- Merigold's Hailstorm
- Dragon's Dream (LUL)
- Pit Trap

Play only on two rows to play around:
- Heatwave/Ragh nar Roog
- Crow's Eye
- Expired Ale
- Pyrotechnician

When playing on two rows, play on Melee and Siege to play around:
- White Frost

Place your armored, unimportant and/or 1 strength units on the far left to play around:
- Skellige Storm
- Birna Bran

Place weaker units on the ends of each row to play around:
- Milaen
- Crushing Trap

When possible, put low units between 4+ strength units to play around:
- Arachas Venom

Put your engines on the far right to play around:
- Skellige Storm
(also, playing engines and 10+ strength units on the far right plays around Assassin, as the 1 strength spy will be on the far right, making Milaen and Crushing Trap weaker)

When possible, play units higher than 4/6 on one row to play around:
- Crow's Eye
- Expired Ale

When possible, place your important 7 strength units on stacked rows to play around:
- Panther

If you have units on the Ranged row, do not fill the Siege row because of:
- Rock barrage

There is some merit to playing into weather (depending on the situation) to play around:
- Bridge Troll
- Drowner

Be sure not to put all your boosts on one row to play around:
- Dimeritium Bomb
- Geralt Yrden

Do not play high strength units to the right of low strength units play around:
- Fringilla Vigo

**Keep your eye on all possible Duel targets**

When possible, separate units on/near to the Fibonnaci sequence to play around:
- Treason
- Iorveth: Meditation

Keep in mind that many common movement units must be played on the opposite row to move a unit to that row. When possible, you want to benefit from that fact.

Similar to Arachas Venom, be wary of Trebuchet.

You may want to develop a third row in shorter rounds to avoid Geralt: Igni.

Also, be wary of putting 1 strength units everywhere as Vandergrift will be a popular pick (and with a lesser popularity, Sabrina Glevissig).
