== Midrange Dj's Band No Specials ==

Description: 
 This is the only deck I created during this month 
 and reached rank 17 from rank 30. Winrate ~ 60%.  

Key cards: Sigi Reuven, Grand Inquisitor, Borsodi Brothers especially Ewald Borsodi, Greater Brothers, Tax Collector and Sly Seductress. 

Strategy:
 
 Round 1: you need to win round 1 to not give your opponnent chance to bleed you in round 2 as always :D 
Also sometimes depending on the matchup you have to secure last say in order to not give your opponent a chance to destroy your Big Boys (Greater Brothers and Procession of Penance) 
 
 Round 2: dry pass or you can bleed your opponent if you are sure that he hasn't big last say and you have enough amount of coins.
 
 Round 3: it is great to go first in round 3 and set up your engines, Dj and Ewald Borsodi before your opponent. If you secured last say then you should win with Geralt, Procession of Penance, Greater Brothers.

Possible replacements: 
 Imke -> Knickers (just for fun and >random< thinning)
 Philippa -> Savolla (you need Imke)
