**Question**: what is the probability to find "Shupe: Mage -> charm a random enemy" given in 3 options.

**Explanation**:

So, we have 3 options. We gonna use multiplication between probabilities to express that we can choose only one card among 3 options.

**4/5** means there are four cards can be placed on the first place and this is not including our card. In that way we are trying to get value from the "negative side". 

Chance to not get card: **4/5 * 3/4 * 2/3 = 2/5 = 40%**

Chance to get card: **1 - (4/5 * 3/4 * 2/3) = 3/5 = 60%**

Answer is **60%**.
