    "\n",
    "To get max value out of Seltkirk, you want to kill your target in EXACTLY two hits while also using up all of your armor. If you kill it in one or don't use up all your armor, then you're missing potential value. If you can't kill your target by the second hit, you will be taking unnecessary damage (!) and your subsequent attacks get weaker. The max potential value with Seltkirk is calculated by the following formula: **2P + A** where **P** - power, **A** - armor\n",
    "\n",
    "Max value target: **1.5P + 0.5A**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Explanation*: we need to kill an enemy in two turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let **Y** be the power of your target.\n",
    "\n",
    "After first hit enemy power will be: **(Y - P)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enemy does **(Y - P - A)** damage to Seltkirk, where **A** - armor of Seltkirk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seltkirk's second hit does **(P- (Y - P - A))** which needs to kill enemy, who is sitting at **(Y-P)** power. So, if you set those two expressions *equal* to each other, that's when Seltkirk's 2nd hit is just enough to kill the target, so you will get the biggest target that can still be killed in two hits.\n",
    "\n",
    "So P - (Y - P - A) = Y- P\n",
    "\n",
    "  2*P - Y + A = Y - P\n",
    "\n",
    "  3P + A = 2Y\n",
    "\n",
    "  Y = 1.5P + 0.5A\n",
    " \n",
    "A max value target is one that has a power of at least **P + A**, and at most **1.5P + 0.5A**. This is assuming your **target has no armor**! So for a 8 PWR Seltkirk, you get max value for hitting a target between 11 and 13 PWR. For a 10 PWR Seltkirk, it's a target between 13 and 16 PWR.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your target has power lower than P + A, your value is decreased by 1 for each power lower. If your target has power higher than 1.5P + 0.5A, your value falls off pretty quickly, and rapidly reaches a lower bound of P, which occurs when your target is at least 2*P + A (meaning it kills Seltkirk on its first retaliation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**TL;DR**: Seltkirk's value increases by 2 for each point he's buffed. His max potential value is **2*P + A**, which is achieved by choosing a target that he kills in exactly two hits and destroys all of Seltkirk's armor on their retaliation hit."
