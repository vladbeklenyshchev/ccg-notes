    "Say unit1 has power x and unit2 has power y, where x < y.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would do maximum damage if $ y = \\phi * x $ with the golden ratio $\\phi = 1.6180...$. This is a **limit situation** (only if the battle goes on for ever). Even so, it is a really good rule of thumb:\n",

    "*pick the highest enemy, divide it's power by the golden ratio ($\\phi$), and pick the other enemy closest to that value * \n",

    "## Is there an easy way to do Iorveth: Meditation math in your head?\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The best ratio for Iorveth is when one minion is 60% of the other (e.g. 6 into 10 strength)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Additionally to the 60% thing, the ideal targets are cards that form a part of the Fibbonacci sequence: \n",
    "   \n",
    "   **1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34...**\n",
    "    \n",
    "   If you choose 8 and 13, you'll deal 20 points of damage, only one card surviving with 1 str.\n",

    "We call $n^{th}$ - element of the fibo sequence $a^n$. Then $a^n = a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}$ (definition of this sequence).\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of unit y after being attacked $n$ times we call $y^n$, and the same for $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As $x$ attacks first, we have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(A)**\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "y^n = y^{n-1} - x^{n-1} \\\\\n",
    "x^n = x^{n-1} - y^{n} \n",
    "\\end{cases} \n",
    "with $x^0 = x$ and $y^0 = y$\n",

    "We now prove that\n",
    "**(B)**\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",

    "\n",
    "### Using induction: \n",
    "**(B)** is our *induction hypothesis* and **(A)** is a useful identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Base case $n=1$: \n",
    "\n",
    " $ y^1= 1y - 1x = a^1y - a^2x $ and $ x^1 = 1x - y^1 = 2x - y = a^3x-a^2y $\n",

    " We see that **(B)** holds for $n = 1$\n",

    "$y^{k+1} = y^k - x^k = a^{2k-1}y - a^{2k}x - (a^{2k+1}x-a^{2k}y) = a$. And a similar calculation for x. \n",

    "We have proven **(B)** using induction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Now, what can we use this for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we want the units to fight each other as long as possible, because then they take the most damge. In math & phisics *as long as possible* means infinitely long. So, **the units must stay alive**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore $y^n\\ge0$ and $x^n\\ge0$ for any n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **(B)** $0\\le y^n = a^{2n-1}y - a^{2n}x$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we exclude $y^n$ and express $y$, we'll get \n",
    "\n",
    "$$y\\ge x(\\frac{a^{2n}}{a^{2n-1}})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the limit of $n$ to infinity gives us the golden ratio:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lim_{n->\\inf} {\\frac{a^{2n}}{a^{2n-1}}} = \\phi = 1.618...$ (a-priory -> [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio#Relationship_to_Fibonacci_sequence)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us one bound $y\\ge \\phi x$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the other equation in **(B)** gives us $0<x^n = a^{2n+1}x - a^{2n}y$. Rewriting this gives us \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y\\le x(\\frac{a^{2n+1}}{a^{2n}})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and this gives our other bound: $y\\le \\phi x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude [заключаем] that in the **limit situation**: $y = \\phi x$.\n",
