## Description 

Sometimes I find time to play CCGs and write a couple of notes on the material I studied. This repository stores information about various concepts and mechanics of various CCGs (Gwent, MTG, etc.), which I learned on streams, on reddit and in the game itself. Also you can find here analysis of cards, math proofs and tips.

Draft - [Ben Stark](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCayul8sNRs5TatadTyYh4Eg) is one of the best limited minds MTG has, and he almost exclusively streams limited. 

> He teaches pick by pick, explaining the overall goal and what the meta for the set is. His guidance and insight got me to Mythic the first two seasons and continues to make me better. Legend is great too, I’ve followed him since the old console client Magic: Duels days, and he’s consistent.

Draft - [LegenVD](https://www.youtube.com/user/LegenVD) is great. He spends lots of time making and explaining his picks or different options.

Draft - [LSV](https://www.twitch.tv/LSV) also does limited set reviews on Channel Fireball.
