# gwent-notes
*Description*: 
Sometimes I find time to play Gwent and write a couple of notes on the material I studied. This repository stores information about concepts and mechanics of Gwent, which I learned on the streams, on reddit and in the game itself. Also you can find here analysis of cards, math proofs and tips concerning cards.
