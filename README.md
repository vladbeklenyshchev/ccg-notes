## Description 

Sometimes I find time to play CCGs and write a couple of notes on the material I studied. This repository stores information about various concepts and mechanics of various CCGs (Gwent, MTG, etc.), which I learned on streams, on reddit and in the game itself. Also you can find here analysis of cards, math proofs and tips.
