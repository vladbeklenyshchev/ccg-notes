    "\n",
    "Generally, in game of Gwent, one player wins the first round, the other player wins the second round, and the outcome of a match is decided in the third round.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ROUND 3: THE ONLY ROUND THAT MATTERS?\n",
    "\n",
    "In round 3, you're in it to win it. You're going to play all your cards (with few exceptions), and the things that will determine the victor are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Who has **card advantage (CA)**\n",
    "- Who is **playing first**\n",
    "- Who has better **card quality**\n",
    "- **Round length**\n",
    "- The outcome of **random effects**\n",
    "- **Sequencing**\n",
    "- **Mistakes** - most notably what you choose to play into or around\n",
    "- Anything **carried over** from previous rounds (most often through resilience)\n",
    "\n",
    "The factors you can affect during round 3 - making less mistakes and having better sequencing can only really improve with experience (as you learn about your deck, the meta, what to play around, etc…).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Gwent Concepts: Card Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "Card advantage refers to the difference between the number of cards in your opponent's hand and your cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it important?\n",
    "\n",
    "- More cards = more points\n",
    "- Importance of Last Play (last say)\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps more importantly, the combination of card advantage and who plays first determines who will have the last play of the round (sometimes multiple last plays in a row, if the card advantage is large). The importance of this varies from deck to deck and from match-up to match-up. Some examples of cards that care about this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Succubus - The later you play this, the less likely it is that your opponent has an answer.\n",
    "- Merigold's Hailstorm - Playing this as the last play can allow you to hit more units.\n",
    "- Kambi - Nullifies any points either player has accumulated so far. The outcome of the round will depend on how many cards players have remaining (and the quality of those cards)\n",
    "- John Natalis, Queensguard, Joachim de Wett, etc… - High point plays such as these become better if your opponent doesn't get the chance to respond to them (with something like a Merigold's Hailstorm or Geralt: Igni)\n",
    "- Vilgefortz into Ciri:Nova - Ciri:Nova is the most powerful card in the game if she is the last card placed on the board but she is so weak when opponent can kill her using Vilgefortz or Scorch. So CA is the most important thing for decks builded around Ciri:Nova.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do you gain Card Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to gain something in Gwent, there is always a tradeoff (компромисс). To gain card advantage you often need to sacrifice card quality, points, or another valuable resource. There are three different ways to get CA in Gwent :\n",
    "1. Card Advantage spies. Play spy to get CA and additional deck thinning. When to play spy:\n",
    "  - You win round 1 and you want to bleed opponent in round 2 (or you know your opponent has a wardancer or another carryover)\n",
    "  - Your opponent passed in round 1 and you are ahead of more than 13 points. You can throwaway your spy without loss of any points. This is bad because you can bleed your opponent in round 2 and you waste a silver card.\n",
    "  - You can block Scorch/Igni or you can use your spy to move an enemy on it's row with weather.\n",
    "  - Don't play spy in round 3!\n",
    "2. Gold cards like Ciri, Ocvist. Be aware of locks and removal :)\n",
    "3. Passing when ahead (or at parity). If you pass while you have more points on the board in round 1, your opponent has two options: \n",
    "  - They can pass, allowing you to win the round - this is usually a very good outcome for you, as that means they had essentially thrown away a card last turn.\n",
    "  - More often, they choose to play one or more cards in order to overcome your score, which would improve your CA.\n",
    " \n",
    " In round 2, the former[первый вариант] is not an option if you had won the first round, so your opponent is obliged to play more cards. Situations where this might gain you card advantage include:\n",
    " \n",
    " - Making higher point plays than your opponent (because they are setting up their engine e.g. weather) and passing quite early in the round. You need a nice **tempo** for that.\n",
    " - The **'dry pass'**. Passing in round 2 after winning in round 1, forcing your opponent to play a cards (provided they don't have carryover, or more precisely, more carryover than you).\n",
    "\n",
    "## CARD ADVANTAGE ISN'T EVERYTHING?\n",
    "\n",
    "Card advantage almost always comes at a cost - whether that be having to use better cards than your opponent before round 3 or not achieving other important objectives, such as thinning or winning the round. It is important to not get carried away and spend too many resources in the pursuit of card advantage, as that might lead you to not having enough firepower to win the match. But in this game, where there are a problem with **Coin Flip**, CA is the most important thing."

    "# Gwent Concepts: Thinning\n",
    "\n",
    "In Gwent, it is almost always correct to play decks of the smallest possible size - 25 cards. There are a plethora [большой избыток] of reasons for this, but they all revolve [вращаются] around improving the **consistency** of your deck, allowing for your game plan to be executed more reliably. This is ever more important in Gwent (compared to other CCGs) because of the limits placed on the <u>amount</u> of Gold and Silver cards that can be included in any deck. Having a larger deck size would result in seeing these more powerful cards less frequently, and would decrease the average value of cards you play.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Increasing your deck's consistency through thinning\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of thinning encompasses [охватывает] cards that remove other cards from the deck in some way and thus decrease the remaining deck size. Thinning can take all manner of forms, from units that pull out copies of themselves (known as 'mustering'[собирание]) (e.g. Mahakam Volunteers), to units that allow you to play a specific card from your deck (e.g. Pirate Captain), to units with the words 'draw a card' imprinted upon them (e.g. Avallach).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important component of thinning is *the removal of bronzes from the deck*. This helps optimise your draws at the start of rounds 2 and 3, maximising the chances to grab your powerful silvers and golds, and making your deck more consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a note on thinning and sequencing. It is desirable to increase the average card quality and power of the cards you’re playing by thinning as many bronzes out of your deck as you can before using draw effects like *Avallac'h*, or effects that allow you to play one of the top cards of your deck, like *The Last Wish*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The costs of thinning\n",
    "\n",
    "Since thinning is generally seen as a benefit, cards that thin have one or more drawbacks to balance that out. These include:\n",
    "- restricted [ограниченные] mulligan options. You are often obliged to mulligan these cards away, which constrains your ability to freely optimise your hand and blacklist. **E**: Roach,Blue Mountain Command, Dun Banner Light Cavalry.\n",
    "- decreased power or randomness. There are definitely ways to mitigate both of these drawbacks, for instance by playing multiple Impera Brigades with your Emissary cards or making sure that every bronze unit in your deck will provide good value in the event that it gets pulled by Rally. **E**: Emissary, Elven Mercenary, Barclay Els.\n",
    "- the opportunity cost of using silver and gold slots for thinning. **E**: Nature's Gift, Royal Decree, Alzur's Double–Cross, Ge'els, The Crones.\n",
    "- lack of flexibility. Some thinning cards,  such as Reaver Scout are conditional on what cards you have on the board, or in your deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The perils (риски) of thinning too much\n",
    "\n",
    "While the previous section considered the costs associated with individual thinning cards (or card sets), there are also drawbacks to running too many of these cards in a single deck:\n",
    "- over-thinning. Everyone starts a game of Gwent with 10 cards, and draws 3 more over its duration. Thus, in a typical 25 card deck (which is what you'll be running under most circumstances), it is imperative that you include 12 or less sources of thinning, otherwise you'll simply run out of cards! (there are some interesting exceptions to this - discussed in the next section)\n",
    "- diminishing returns [уменьшение прибыли]. There are definitely diminishing returns to thinning, exacerbated by the mulligans at the start of rounds 2 and 3. Thinning 10-12 cards decreases the value of your round 2 and 3 mulligans and thus also reduces the value of situational cards like Dimeritium Bomb and Mardroeme.\n",
    "- offensive thinning. Another knock against excessive thinning is that there are a number of cards in the game that allow your opponent to thin your deck, which can potentially leave you with no cards to draw. A perfect example is Tibor Eggebracht,\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using thinning to your advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite all the pitfalls of excessive [чрезмерного] thinning, there are several ways to benefit from it, or at least mitigate the problems outlined above:\n",
    "- conditional thinning. This refers to cards that can thin your deck, but don't have to, and are still powerful if you don't. There's only a few examples of these, most notably Vicovaro Novice choosing to copy the ability of an Ambassador rather than an Emissary.\n",
    "- including more than 25 cards. You can do this if you aware of Mill but...**The more cards you run, the fewer silvers and golds will find their way into your opening hand**. Ordinarily there are other drawbacks too, such as decreased consistency and having to pay a cost for including more bronze thinning, so this is almost never correct. \n",
    "- thinning in reverse. And finally, there's a few cards in Gwent that allow you to increase your deck size by putting cards back into your deck. The most notable examples are Ciri: Dash, Assire var Anahid and Nenneke, and these can be used to enable excessive thinning and/or to provide a payoff for it. For example, you can shuffle back a roach and/or other powerful silvers with Assire to add even more power to your final round gold and increase the card quality for your round 3 draw + mulligan. Certanly, you can even shuffle enemy's bronze units to break his mulligan."
