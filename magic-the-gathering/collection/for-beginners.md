Firstly you should definitely redeem all the free codes for boosters, cardstyles and level up! Most of them work: [link](https://cardgamebase.com/mtg-arena-codes/).

## 05/02/2020 - Best packs to buy from zero collection in MTGA?

### First answer

I'd *probably* start with Eldraine packs so you can hopefully pull the mono lands and fabled passages. Also the best set to buy from if you're wanting to play [RDW](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Red_Deck_Wins), which would still be a pretty good deck for a newcomer.

### Second answer

If you primarily want to play standard/historic: Eldraine.
If you primarily want to play Brawl: Eldraine, splash in some Theros for flavor.

### Third answer

Eldraine and Ikoria. You can skimp out on Theros since it's not as strong of a set. Everything pre-Eldraine will rotate in a few months.

### Conclusion

Eldraine.

## 08/2019 - What should we buy for MTG (not Arena)?

### First answer

To start out, I don't personally think that the *planeswalker decks* are a good investment, especially for your group's case. The *welcome decks* should be a good starting point for learning to play, but I'd also recommend finding experienced players in your community to give tutorials on the game, since getting started can be very confusing, especially coming from another card game (you'll habitually make incorrect assumptions about the rules).

> Planeswalkers are like ascended creatures. Think of it like summoning a superhero to fight alongside you. Planeswalkers can be attacked like players, though they can't attack back (though oftentimes their abilities can be directed against enemy creatures or players).

The *welcome deck* boxes are essentially just packaging. Most premade-deck products come in some sort of cardboard deck box just to provide some level of basic protection. Welcome decks are a good place to start because they're free, and meant to help new players learn the game. 

*Booster boxes* and *booster packs* are seen as a bad way to purchase cards, since:

1. You won't get the cards you want to build constructed decks (because they're so random)
2. There's always a chance that the cards you randomly get in packs won't be worth as much as you paid

The general consensus is that *booster packs* are for gambling and *booster boxes* are for <u>drafting</u>. I do recommend everyone pitches in for a booster box to draft if all of you have interest in playing the game after practicing. <u>Drafting is a good way to practice deck building</u> and add cards to your collection without necessarily purchasing singles. Plus, as a group you'll be able to trade with your friends to get cards you want, but didn't open in the packs you opened.

Buying a *booster box* is expensive for a beginner, but it might be the best investment your group could make as a collective. It is also good for <u>drafting</u>. Drafting refers to a format where each player gets three packs, picks a card from the first pack, passes it on, then picks a card from the pack they were passed and repeats the process until the first pack for each player is empty. Each player then opens the second pack and repeats, then third pack and repeats, then makes a 40-card deck from the cards that they've picked. A standard booster box contains 36 packs, which is enough for 12 people to draft, or two drafts for your group (plus six packs left over).

Using your draft pool to build decks is fine for playing against each other, but competitive formats like standard or modern (what other players in the wild will likely be playing) have access to many more cards than you will, not just from a single booster box, but from a single set in general. Not only that, but their decks will be fine-tuned and more consistent, with multiple copies of the cards that they want to play. Deck building for a constructed format (a format where you show up with a deck already made, instead of making it on the spot) is serious and can be expensive. I didn't get a standard deck until just recently, when I bought a *Challenger Deck* (a preconstructed standard deck), and I had been playing for over a year and a half before I bought the deck. It's not particularly refined or competitive, and won't beat a well-made deck 95% of the time. I don't recommend getting into a competitive constructed format any time soon.

In terms of deck-building, the general consensus is to buy *commander decks* to start out, since they're generally fairly balanced and a good starting point for having a realistic deck. The next set of commander decks will launch late August, though there will only be four unique decks this year (players in your group would have to double up on at least one of them). You could also be on the lookout for last year's commander decks to include if you don't want to have multiple people playing the same deck.

I suggested commander because it's the people's game. A lot of people you'll find have commander decks, and it's generally a very casual format. The general appeal is that you pick one legendary creature to be able to cast whenever you want throughout the game, then build a deck around that card. You can build just about whatever kind of deck you want, and you don't have to worry about how competitive it is. Plus, due to the lack of competitiveness of the format, and the fact that you can only have one of each card that's not a basic land, you don't have to worry about buying four copies of an expensive card to make you deck consistent like you do in a format like standard or modern. It's the perfect format for making budget decks and not always feeling like you're outdone by everyone around you. In the past, the preconstructed decks you'd be able to find in a store could range from mediocre to very powerful out-of-the-box, but lately they've been trying to make them more balanced (bringing down the maximum power level, but making the decks more equal against each other).

You'll likely want to play [Magic Arena](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena) to better your feel for the game, as well as to refresh what you've learned.

Also, **please don't buy repackaged cards.** In most cases, they're cards that aren't worth anything and they've been sorted by the person selling them, with the cards of any value being sold individually or kept in their collection.

Anyway, like I was saying before about booster packs, they're not meant to be used to get the cards you want. If you want specific cards (and you will for making a real deck), you're best off buying them individually.

### Second answer

The *planeswalker decks* are ok-ish, but dont offer many cards that could be used down the road - maybe you can get older ones from Guilds of Ravnica or Ravnica Allegiance for cheap - or ask in a good store, many offer selfmade decks for cheap.

*Challenger decks* are much better than PW decks and not much more expensive, the *Guild Kits* are nice as well, but not standard legal :( - on the upside they are balanced to be played against each other and offer a lot of interesting mechanics; something the PW decks lack of. And they contain a lot of good cards for other formats.

Maybe it would be a good start to get some *precons* (preconstructed decks) to play against each other and go to a store as well. Ask if they offer an open house, where you get free decks and usually some promo cards. You could as well go for some drafts, meet other players and learn how to build decks. If you want to get serious in magic you will need a place to trade cards, a store offering <u>Friday Nights</u> is a great place to do so.

The idea of getting a *booster box* might leave you with not enough cards to build decks for everyone, eventually no one to trade with and it is pretty hard to balance the decks in a way that its fun to play them against each other - that's the benefit of the *precons*. Buying Boosters usually isn't the way to go if you want to build decks, because buying the singles is just less expensive!

> Think Planeswalker decks as Starter decks and Challenger decks as Structure decks. Deckbuilder Kits are usually a more uniformed bunch of common/uncommon cards to build simple but weak decks with. I personally don't think they're worth it.
>
> I think the best way to go is to buy all four of the Challenger decks to play against each other to learn more about the game.
>
> To be honest I'm not sure why someone suggested Commander because that format is completely different to play compared to regular Magic. It's fine to try something else I guess, but it's tough if you're trying to learn the game.

### Third answer

The *challenger decks* are explicitly competitive and contain many cards which are staples in Tier 1 decks. The major downside is, that many of these cards will rotate in fall, so you wont be able to play them in official standard events after that. The red and white decks are very close to current tier 1 decks. The green/black one is the weakest. Make sure you get the 2019 ones, these a set of challenger decks from 2018.

[Core Set 2020/Deck Builder's Toolkit](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Core_Set_2020/Deck_Builder's_Toolkit). Absolutely not enough for splitting or anything. Its just nice <u>for new players</u>, in Europe they usually cost 1â‚¬ more than the included boosters, so you get a nice box and 200 cards for that one buck. But if I had the choice, I would go with either the challenger decks - if I wanted to play events in a store - or the guild kits - if I wanted to play with four friends.

The challenger decks are more competitive and standard legal until fall, the guild kits have more variety and the cards have a higher monetary value, so you would be more likely to use them in trades if you want to get rid if them.

### Conclusion

*Boosters* are **bad**. Buying Boosters usually isn't the way to go if you want to build decks, because buying the singles is just less expensive!

Buying a *booster box* is expensive for a beginner, but it might be the best investment your group could make as a collective. It is also good for <u>drafting</u>. <u>Drafting is a good way to practice deck building</u> and add cards to your collection without necessarily purchasing singles. Anyway, boosters and booster boxes are not meant to be used to get the cards you want. If you want specific cards (and you will for making a real deck), you're best off buying them individually. In general, booster box is **bad**.

The *planeswalker decks* are ok-ish, but dont offer many cards that could be used down the road. Not super powerful, but good **for beginners** (you can buy 5 planeswalker decks). Later you could try splitting a booster box.

The *challenger decks* are more competitive and standard legal until fall. They are great if you want to play in a store. Plus, some of the cards are staples in Tier 1 decks. Think Planeswalker decks as Starter decks and Challenger decks as Structure decks. So, they are a **good investment**.

The *guild kits* have more variety and the cards have a higher monetary value, so you would be more likely to use them in trades if you want to get rid if them. Also, they are **great if you want to play with four friends**.

*Deckbuilder kits* are usually a more uniformed bunch of common/uncommon cards to build simple but weak decks with. They are **bad**.

In terms of deck-building, the general consensus is to buy *commander precons decks* to start out, since they're generally fairly balanced and a good starting point for having a realistic deck. They aren't really good against optimized decks, but are very playable in casual games [3]. The most important thing, though, is that the lists come with many staples (cards that are a good fit in a LOT of decks), which is awesome for when you start building your own decks. If these are going to be your first physical MTG cards, that's definitely worth it. The commander decks are not a great entry point for people brand new to magic. So, commander precons decks are **good**.

> I went to my local game store and bought the Wizard deck with Inalla as the commander from a couple years ago. It was fun as it was, but the best part was that <u>it was really easy to upgrade</u>. Now that I have, it's become the most hated deck in my playgroup because of how easy I get infinite turns. So yeah, I totally suggest using Commander 2019 as a stepping stone into Commander. I would go with whatever deck has a strategy that interests you the most, because it might be a deck you stick with for a while.

The Game Night box is great **investment for absolute beginners** who want to involve their friends in the game. Although, it provides too standard and simple gameplay.

## Is it good to start from Duel Decks?

### First answer

Honestly, skip them. The mechanics are far too advanced for learning straight away. Lastly the cheap one is badly balanced so one deck is always straight stomping the other making it really unfun to play with a friend.

A planeswalker deck is about $12-19 for one. Get one for you and another PW for your SO (Dominaria just released chandra and teferi decks for example). The mechanics are more straightforward, and hold just as much play value which is to say they aren't made for playing against other decks except each other.

If you want a FREE taste of magic, call around local game stores and explain youre new and if they have any Welcome decks. Wizards gives LGS' these welcome decks to hand out for FREE to new players (dont get scammed into paying $5 for them).

### Second answer

Honestly, I would recommend in order:

1. Card Kingdom [Rookie or Battle Decks](https://www.cardkingdom.com/static/specialties). Well balanced against each other, and a great starting point.
2. Of the Duel Decks, **Izzet vs. Golgari** or Elspeth vs. Kiora are fairly balanced but a lot more complex in game play than the CK decks.
3. The Challenger decks. Powered down versions of great standard decks, they are balanced against each other and easy to learn the game with.

After those, when you start getting the hang of things, I would say go for Commander Precons, to a Prerelease, or get some packs to do some sealed with.

### Third answer

All of those Duel Decks are at least a dynamic experience. I would rank them as follows:

1. *Izzet vs. Golgari*
2. *Elspeth vs. Kiora*
3. *Mind vs. Might*

*Izzet vs. Golgari* is one of the best of all the Duel Decks series. Each deck has a game plan but tools to adapt to new scenarios or to interact with the opponent's strategy. The Izzet deck is a Blue-Red control deck with powerful noncreature spells, utility creatures, and some evasive threats. The Golgari deck is a Black-Green graveyard recursion deck that builds momentum with growing inevitable threats. Both decks are complex and give the players many options. The mechanics are simple on the surface but create good depth. The Golgari deck is probably a bit harder to pilot, especially for new players who might not intuitively treat the graveyard as a resource.

*Elspeth vs. Kiora* is a personal favorite of mine. Like Izzet vs. Golgari, each of these decks has a distinct gameplan and some ability to adapt if the initial plan fails. The Elspeth deck is a classic White weenie aggro deck, but Elspeth, Captain of the Watch, and Dictate of Heliod give the deck some late game staying power if Kiora successfully stalls the early game. The Kiora deck is a Blue-Green ramp ramp deck with large, impactful creatures, but it also has some early game utility creatures that can create positive tempo plays or at least leave chump blockers before the big creatures come down. The Elspeth deck is a little more straightforward than the Kiora deck, but there are some tricks in both decks that keep the match up interesting.

> Elspeth VS Kiora is one of the best. Both decks run midrange strategies, Elspeth focusing on going wide with Soldier tokens/tribal, and Kiora going tall, ramping to huge monsters. The games are incredibly swingy, and the decks are greatly balanced against each other. I bought mine when it was new, so I don't know the prices these days.

> One note: Mixing and matching duel decks can be fun, but they're designed specifically to face their paired mate. I might suggest the new Planeswalker decks. They're standalone, single decks, and they're quite well-designed, strong, and fun!

> Mind vs. Might is probably the worse to present to newish players, Mind is a ridiculously powerful (for what you would expect) Combo deck. I used it to reintroduce someone to the game and quickly regretted it. Not before Storming of with Mind's Desire though.

### Conclusion

Honestly, skip Duel Decks. The mechanics are far too advanced for learning straight away. However, if you want to learn then you should buy *Izzet vs. Golgari* or *Elspeth vs. Kiora*. *Mind vs. Might* is also good. After the Duel Decks, you can buy The Challenger deck that are powered down versions of great standard decks, they are balanced against each other and easy to learn the game with. After those, when you start getting the hang of things, I would say go for Commander Precons, to a Prerelease, or get some packs to do some sealed with.
