# For beginners

Firstly you should definitely redeem all the free codes for boosters, cardstyles and level up! Most of them work: [link](https://cardgamebase.com/mtg-arena-codes/).

## 05/02/2020 - Best packs to buy from zero collection in MTGA?

### First answer

I'd *probably* start with Eldraine packs so you can hopefully pull the mono lands and fabled passages. Also the best set to buy from if you're wanting to play [RDW](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Red_Deck_Wins), which would still be a pretty good deck for a newcomer.

### Second answer

If you primarily want to play standard/historic: Eldraine.
If you primarily want to play Brawl: Eldraine, splash in some Theros for flavor.

### Third answer

Eldraine and Ikoria. You can skimp out on Theros since it's not as strong of a set. Everything pre-Eldraine will rotate in a few months.

### Conclusion

Eldraine.
