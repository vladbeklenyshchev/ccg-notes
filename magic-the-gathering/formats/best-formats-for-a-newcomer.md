# Best formats for a newcomer

## Constructed

According to Reddit [1]:

Assuming you're not building for a specific event (meaning you get to choose your format), what you'll want to do is weigh your interests with respect to "fun", "entry cost", and "upkeep cost".

[Legacy](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/legacy) is the most fun, has the highest entry cost (~2400-3500$), and the lowest upkeep cost (in a long run). It allows cards from all legal sets, but bans certain cards for power level reasons.

> If you have several thousand dollars to blow, I would definitely consider Legacy. ...(lots of combo) and the deepest interactions...

[Modern](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/modern) is the most realistic, is the respectably fun format, has a moderate entry cost (~1000-2000$), and a moderate upkeep cost. Cards from Core Set Eighth Edition and Mirrodin through today are legal in this format. Again, decks require a minimum of sixty cards and may have a sideboard of up to fifteen cards. 

> If you have around a thousand to blow, I'd try Modern. There's a lot less combo in Modern, but it is still an interactive format with a bunch of possible decks.
>
> For a 1k investment, Modern is probably the way to go. While I think Legacy is the "best" format, whatever that means because they're not enemies and should all exist and be celebrated, Modern is still awesome as all get out, and 1k in Legacy really forces you onto only a handful of competitive strategies. Compared to Legacy, there are all sorts of fun things you can do in Modern with 1k.
>
> Risks of modern include banning of cards. This does happen, and it often effects tier 1decks. Be a aware of that. You will still find that modern is a good, long term; investment.

[Pauper](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/pauper) is the best fun for your dollar. Pauper restricts decks to only cards with the common rarity. There are almost no IRL competitive events for Pauper.

[Standard](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/standard-formats-magic-gathering) is the intentionally simplified format, has the lowest entry cost (is usually the cheapest upfront ~ 500$), and the highest upkeep cost. Standard is what everyone thinks is the best fun for their dollar, but the rotation secretly makes it very <u>expensive</u> in the long run. The Standard format uses the most recently released Magic sets. Every year you might find yourself essentially starting from scratch as cards rotate out of format.

> I personally don't like standard, but it's a fine format. No combo, mostly midrange/aggro decks.

### Pauper

According to Reddit [2]:

> Pauper is pretty diverse, so any style of deck can work! 

##### First answer

If I were to recommend the simplest strong deck to play, which is newbie-friendly, it'd be [GW Slivers](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/pauper-wg-slivers-44640#paper).

If I were to recommend the strongest deck for the cost (best bang for your buck), it'd be [UB Control](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/pauper-blue-black-control-40728#paper) (~$40), [WB Pestilence](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/pauper-wb-pestilence-57532#paper) (~$32), or [Mono-W Heroic](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/pauper-mono-white-heroic#paper) (~$40). All different deck types, with Control, Mid-Range, and Aggro respectively.

##### Second answer

Short answer: Stompy. Longer answer: it will teach you some important things about board control, combat tricks and resources management, that are basic MTG concepts.

##### Third answer

If you were a friend of mine nearby, and I could create a path to getting into the format, and the game, then I would do the following:

1. Go to your Local Game Store (LGS) and pick up free intro decks. They will be free, as they are provided by Wizards for new players. Might also be called new player kits, or new player decks. Anyways, these are built to be opened and played and touch on the basics of Magic. Play these until you have a decent grasp of turn progression and the various phases that you have to go through each turn.
2. If you are looking to specialize in Pauper, or at least focus on pauper before venturing out to other formats (unless, cheekily, you want to stay in pauper, which none of us would complain about) I would spend a good amount of time ingesting content. Be it the laundry list of deck tech videos that the Professor over at Tolarian Community College on YouTube, or fellow Canadian AnyNewProvinces pair of great YouTube series that explore the meta decks, and the fringe fun decks. These are two resources that I use to keep up to date with some other lists, and watch some other people play. Watching people play can be as valuable as playing yourself. Seriously.
3. MTGGOLDFISH'S Pauper Meta page is a good resource to see all the decks that are putting up positive results in MAGIC ONLINE challenges. MTGGOLDFISH is the industry standard for knowing what decks are doing well, and what the diversity of a format looks like. As you look through these decks you might start seeing patterns in what we call "shells" of decks. Tron, UB Control, Delver variants. Pauper is a brewers paradise and you will find that the odd rogue card here or there can shift the meta.
4. Pick a straightforward deck in pauper to begin with, at least until you understand the game better. There are a few streamlined decks out there, effectively decks that you have a linear strategy. People get upset when they get told to pick something simple, but you will learn a lot about the format when you can take in what your opponent is playing earlier on, instead of struggling playing your own deck for a bunch of matches. So with that all said, I would suggest going with something like:
   1. [Mono Red Burn:](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/pauper-burn-50950#paper) This deck is all about instant speed burn spells and smashing them into your opponents face, all the while dropping a couple creatures that maximize the burn each time you cast a spell at your opponent. Its LINEAR because you don't have a ton of interaction with your opponents board. You are looking for a great starting hand, and hoping they don't main board hate cards against instant speed strategies. Oh, and the mana is easy. One color. Which brings me to my next suggestion.
   2. Mono Red, or [Mono White Heroic](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/pauper-mono-white-heroic#paper). Mono white is by far the strongest of the heroic decks. My first pauper deck in paper was Mono Red Heroic. And lining up a BUNCH of 1/1 Soldiers off of a pumped creature and then surprising them with a Temur Battle Rage (effectively doubling the creatures power and trampling through). I enjoyed it a lot, and still have that deck sleeved. However, the stronger of the heroic decks in Mono White. Easy mana, great creatures, and a massive host of instant speed ways to buff the hell outs of your dudes. This deck used to be a powerhouse, then sort of drifted away until a rogue 5-0 result was put up this summer.
   3. If I was "restarting" in pauper, this deck, and the next one I mention are the ones that I would get into. [Bogles](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/pauper-bogles-22844#paper) That's what we call the deck. It's called this because one of the key creatures is called a [[slippery bogle]] The trick behind the deck is that all your creatures are hexproof, and your opponent cant target them with spells. Which makes this deck a tough one to deal with in game one. You cast a creature, and enchant the hell out of him and smash your opponents face. There is a lot of hate cards in sideboards to deal with this deck, however with the right starting hand, it can be ridiculously fast. This is the only deck I will suggest that runs two colors. Green and white. But you can tune the mana base to be super consistent in two colors.
   4. [Mono Green Stompy](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/pauper-stompy-22958#paper) is the last deck I would suggest. I wish I had gotten this deck earlier. It's just a lot of great value cards, and creatures that just create value in extra bodies, or great bodies to throw one of green's all star cards, [[Rancor]], at. Value is the key to this deck. I haven't seen it a lot in paper these days, but its consistently putting up great results online.

5. Play lots of games. Maybe think about investing the $10 (plus no more than $10) to play Magic Online. Or just jam lots of games. You cant learn any better than playing. And play with people better than you. Seriously. Its fun to ensure you cater to friends, but if your statement about wanting to win tournaments is true, then make sure you expand your playgroup by a lot. Why do I say this? I have been playing Magic on and off since 2001. In and out of the game. From casual to modern to commander to modern to pauper. I have won one Friday Night Magic draft, once in 2014. This game is competitive when packs are on the line. A lot of people make magic a bit of a business that pays for itself. Those people get good. You can get better.

##### Fourth answer

There are many budget **RDW** decks out there than can later translate into burn. **Mono W Heroic** is also fairly cheap bogles like deck that is pretty good actually. **G/W Slivers** is a tribal deck that's actually pretty good to pick up.

For control, **UB Control** decks especially the **Teaching** ones are fairly cheap as long as you don't use Chainer's Edict.

##### Fifth answer

What a bunch of people play pauper matches on youtube. you can learn a lot there and decide which deck is for you as well. Also, you can download a free program like **Cockatrice** to proxy up some decks and playtest without spending a single dime.
