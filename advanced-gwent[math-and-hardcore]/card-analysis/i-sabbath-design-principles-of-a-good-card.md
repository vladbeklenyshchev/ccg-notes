# TL;DR

Imlerith Sabbath is a fantastic card. His design employs 4 design principles that all lie under the scope of interactivity. Interactivity in card design is essential in Gwent because the objective of the game (put up more points than your opponent in 2 of 3 rounds) is not inherently interactive like other card games (where you must reduce your opponent’s life total to 0 to win).

# Design principles

## Player Interactivity

The extent to which your cards can interact with your opponent’s cards. We want to have more cards in the game that interact with your opponent, however, they do not necessarily need to be control or removal cards as traditionally seen.

## Deck interactivity/synergy 

The extent to which the cards in your deck interact with each other to create dynamic board states and work toward a unique win condition. Deck interactivity/synergy is important because it creates a healthy meta and allows for the excitement of unique win conditions and brewing. The Create mechanic is fundamentally anti-synergistic, therefore, Create dominating the meta is due to a lack of strong synergistic cards.

## Highly interactive cards can be simple, and they don’t have to be engines

Dwarven Mercenary is an excellent example of a card that is flexible and promotes player interactivity. 

Tutor cards like Wild Hunt Navigator, Reaver Hunter, and Blue Stripes Commando are non-engine cards that impact player decision. 

The essence of player interaction is that your decisions affect the decisions your opponent will make on their next turn. Both players having multiple lines of play and altering them based on what their opponent does, rather than following a prescribed "solitaire-like" play formula. *This creates opportunities to outplay your opponent, make bluffs, and these interactions lead to memorable games* (which makes you want to come back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

## Counterplay

CDPR needs to ensure that there is a diversity of options to counter every strategy and create tech cards that when employed at the right moment can turn the tide of a battle. Alongside this, they need to change create so that tech cards get accessed through a player’s conscious choice to include the card, and not through a slot machine.
