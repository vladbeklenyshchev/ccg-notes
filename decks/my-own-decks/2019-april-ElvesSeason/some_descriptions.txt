Description: 
 This is the most competetive deck I created during this month 
 and reached rank 7 in a short time.

Strategy:
 Round 1: you need to win round 1 in order to secure the last say (Glustyworp or
  Kayran). There are 3 key cards in this deck that would help you to win 
  round 1 but do not commit all cards:
  - Detlaff: Higher Vampire
  - Ruehin
  - Frightener: Dormant
  So you need to consume some cards to get more values.
 Round 2: dry pass or if you think you can destroy your opponent in 3-4 cards - do it.
 Round 3: consume units. It would be nice if you play all cards above. Your last
 say is Glustyworp.

Description:
 This deck is a classic binary deck which supports challenge "You pass - you lose" :)
 Also this deck has the best finisher in the game. You could get 50 points in one card
 and complete contract "Bodybuilder" :)

Strategy:
 Round 1: you need to win round 1 in order to secure last say (Dana->Aglais after Syanna) and 
  bait as many removal/locks as you can with your engines (Swordmaster, Pavko Gale, Boar).
  Also those engines should bait your opponnent to pass. Mulligan Aglais before the round
 Round 2: dry pass!
 Round 3: play your cards. Try to save Thunderbolt for Avallach or Syanna. Your last 3
 cards should be: 
  - Avallach - if he dies or locks, it's okay.
  - Syanna - Use Avallach to give immune for Syanna
  - use Dana to pull Aglais and use Garrison (or Swallow) on her. 
 And you would get 40-50 points finisher.
